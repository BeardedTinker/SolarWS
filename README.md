# ESPHome code for Solar Weather station by Open Green Energy(https://github.com/deba168) - Debasish Dutta 

You will be able to find here file(s) used to power Solar Powered WiFi Weather Station V3.0 by OpenGreenEnergy(https://github.com/deba168).

While most of the functionality has been kept for this ESPHome version, there are currently some limitations and one NO-GO.

Project is still been worked on and while planned release of the code and video is soon(tm), there will always be place for improvement

I really would like to thank Debasish Dutta for creating this project - multiple versions and for sharing it with community!
